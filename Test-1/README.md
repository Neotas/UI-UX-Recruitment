2. Update the interface as the user types his search query.
3. Allow the user to click on any particular movie to view its details.
4. Favourite a movie by clicking on its poster(no server side required, some temporary
way to indicate that on UI should be sufficient)
5. Make the interface as clean as possible, be creative.
