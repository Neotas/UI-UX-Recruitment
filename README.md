# Welcome to Neotas UI/UX Developer Recruitment!

Hi! Good Afternoon. Please read through the following instructions carefully. The duration of the test is 2 hours. The test starts at 12 PM and ends at 2 PM.

The objective of the test is to build a web application from the given UI designs. The application is a Payment Checkout page. *Please note*, do not worry about exact value of margin/padding or card size, just try to replicate the design as closely as you can. We're interested to see your skills for development. The application does not need to be live, static HTML page would work as well, with integrated JS. Requirements are given below: 
-	Buttons should be clickable and the JS should transition the user from one card state to another. 
-	No need to animate, direct transition would work as well. 
-	The last success page we leave to your imagination to design. Get creative, and think of how you imagine the last box to look like.
-	There should be just 1 validation on the page on the card number box. If the length of the card number is not 16, then the box outline should turn red with an error message under it.
